# TicTacToe

This is a very bad Tic-Tac-Toe (or noughts and crosses) type game.
This is not good code. Pls dont look. Very hacky. Very bad.
You'll proably cringe at this piece of shite code.

And if for some reason you want to build this code you'll need CMake, and somekind of modern C++ compiler...
I used Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10 and Debian 12 with Clang 15 to make this atrocity, but I bet this can run on MSYS or a (non-Linux) *NIX system. (And, yes I've tried GCC it works!)

# TODO:

* Better graphics (VT100, ncurses)
* AI
* Clean up code, so it doesn't look *that* bad.
